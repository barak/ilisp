Welcome to ILISP.

ILISP is a GNU Emacs package for controlling an inferior process
running a lisp dialect.  You can get ILISP at
<http://ilisp.cons.org>.


ILISP is currently being maintained by Paolo Amoroso <amoroso@mclink.it>,
Marco Antoniotti <marcoxa@cons.org>, Martin Atzmueller <ygrats@gmx.de> and
William Deakin <w.deakin@pindar.com>.

There is an ILISP mailing list managed by `majordomo'.
Please address all list administration messages, such as requests to
subscribe or unsubscribe, to:

	  <majordomo@cons.org> ILISP Administrivia

To send a message to everyone on the list, address it to:

          <ilisp@cons.org> ILISP Discussion

The list has had a very low volume lately, so you may not see messages
for a while after subscribing.

Please note that there is no "bug" list like ilisp-bugs@cons.org.
The primary list serves the purpose of a general bug fix and
discussion area.

Enjoy
