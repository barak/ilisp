ILISP 5.9 DOC
=============

ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp.

This is the 'doc' directory.

Using 'make' you can produce .dvi, .ps and .info files for ILISP,
starting from the 'ilisp.texi' file.

There is also the 'ilisp-refcard' packag which you may find useful
(provided by Valentino Kyriakides).
