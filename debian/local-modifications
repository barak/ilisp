This version of ILISP has been modified from the original upstream
code.  Per ILISP's licensing, all derivatives of ILISP must be

Programmer: Kevin M. Rosenberg <kmr@debian.org>
Date of Modifications: August 10, 2002

Modified ilisp-hi.el and ilisp-snd.el to use Common Lisp Controller
logical pathnames for storage of ILISP's lisp and compiled lisp
files. The allows compatibility with multiple Lisp implementations
that use the same file type for compiled files. Also, it allows
separate directories for source code in /usr/share and compiled code
in /usr/lib.

Modified ilisp-pkg.lisp to handle AllegroCL's case-sensitive modes.
