The default initialization file for ILISP is installed in
/etc/ilisp/ilisp.el. However, if you wish to override the global
initialization file with a local initialization file, you can install
that file as .ilisp in your home directory. If ~/.ilisp exists, then
the system-wide default file will not be read at all.

Thus, a warning, if you have a .ilisp file in your homn directory, you
are completely on your own to ensure that ilisp is properly
configured.
