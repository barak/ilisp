Description: Do you want to use FSF-compliant keybindings?
 ILISP alows the choice of using FSF-compliant keybindings which
 start with a Control-C character. The older ILISP keybindings use
 a Control-Z character as the prefix.
 .
 In general, the non-FSF compliant keybindings are easier to use for two 
 reasons: the ILISP manual in the Debian package ilisp-doc uses the non-FSF-compliant
 keybindings and these keybindings often use less keystrokes.
 .
 If you change you mind later, you can run
 dpkg-reconfigure ilisp and change your keybinding selection.
