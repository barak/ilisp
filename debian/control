Description: Package for interacting with LISPs using EMACSes
 ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp,
 including Lucid, Allegro, Harlequin LispWorks, GCL, KCL, AKCL, ECL,
 IBCL, and CMUCL.  Also some Scheme implementations are supported as
 well as a preliminary version of Xlisp/XlispStat.
