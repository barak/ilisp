ILISP Extra
===========

ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp.

This is the 'contrib' directory: software that is useful in
conjunction with ILISP.

HyperSpec
---------
You may see three different 'hyperspec' packages here.  Erik Naggum's is
the one currently used, but you may substitute the one of your liking by
changing the link to 'hyperspec.el' (see also the INSTALLATION file).

Note that some software in this directory (HyperSpec packages in
particular) is 'non free', according to the definition accepted by the FSF
(see <http://www.gnu.org> for the definition).  However, the HyperSpec (as
appearing on Xanalys site--formerly Harlequin Ltd.) and these interfaces to
that reference are very valuable to Common Lisp programmers and therefore
they are provided with ILISP, although in a separate directory.
