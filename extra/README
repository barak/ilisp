ILISP 5.9 Extra
=================

ILISP is a powerful GNU Emacs interface to many dialects of Lisp.

This is the 'contrib' directory: software that is useful in
conjunction with ILISP.

Hyperspec
---------
You may see three different 'hyperspec' packages here.  Erik Naggum's
is the one currently used, but you may substitute the one of your
liking by changing the link to 'hyperspec.el'.

Note that some software in this directory (hyperspec in particular) is
'non free', according to the definition accepted by the FSF (see
<http://www.gnu.org> for the definition).  However, the Hyperspec (as
appearing on Harlequin Ltd. site) and these interfaces to that
reference are very valuable to Common Lisp programmers and therefore
they are provided with ILISP, although in a separate directory.
