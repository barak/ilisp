2001-01-05  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

        * docs/ilisp.texi (Acknowledgements): added Craig Brozefsky.
        Updated date info.

        * Welcome: added Craig Brozefsky to the list of maintainers.

2000-12-26  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* ilisp-sch.el, guile-ilisp.scm: Rewrote the Guile arglist
	fetching code, which is more clever now; tested with Guile 1.3.4,
	1.4 and 1.4.1.

	* ilisp-hi.el (ilisp-arglist-message-lisp-space): Don't try to get
	the arglist if point is directly behind a semicolon; the comment
	character would be passed to the Lisp, causing confusion.

2000-12-26  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* INSTALLATION (TIPS): created section and added tip on input
        focus with Enlightment/Gnome (suggested by Marco Antoniotti
        <marcoxa@cons.org>).

2000-12-21  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* guile-ilisp.scm (ilisp-source-file): Made search for source
	properties more reliable.

	* ilisp-low.el (lisp-def.el): Handle some Scheme dialects' curried
	definitions like (define ((f a) b) ...).

2000-12-07  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* ilisp-src.el (edit-definitions-lisp): When using tags, use a
	tags loop with the locator instead of find-tag if SEARCH is
	true. (There are no tags for function calls, only for definitions,
	so search all tagged files for calls.)

	* ilisp-src.el (ilisp-locate-scheme-calls): Don't expect package
	prefixes when locating calls; Scheme does not have package
	prefixes.

2000-12-04  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* ilisp-sch.el (scheme), ilisp-src.el
	(ilisp-locate-scheme-definition, ilisp-locate-scheme-calls): New
	Scheme source locators. The standard locators would fail on
	"(define (thunk) ....)"  and report "(define (procedure ...) ...)" 
	as a procedure call.

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile), guile-ilisp.scm (ilisp-source-file): 
	Get the source file of a definition from the interpreter.
	
	* guile-ilisp.scm (ilisp-trace, ilisp-untrace): I broke these in
	the last change, fixed.

2000-12-03  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* allegro.lisp (allegro-v5.0): added support for ACL 6.0 and
	updated the comment (fix suggested by Larry Hunter
	<Larry.Hunter@uchsc.edu>).

2000-11-30  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Removed comment about Guile support being
	incomplete. (It has been completed.)

2000-11-30  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* Welcome: added info about the SourceForge site and mailing
        lists. Added Matthias Koeppe to the list of
        maintainers. Reformatted.

2000-11-30  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile), guile-ilisp.scm: Updated for Guile 1.4.1.
	Handle the case of unregistered modules.  Send source position
	to the interpreter when evaluating.

	* ilisp-ext.el: Don't clobber C-M-l and C-M-r keybindings in FSF
	compliant mode. Those are bound to `reposition-window' and
	`isearch-backward-regexp', respectively, at least in GNU Emacs 20.

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-eval-command, ilisp-defvar-command): 
	Format strings now take an extra parameter, source LINE. 
	* ilisp-hi.el (lisp-send-region): Send source line to inferior
	lisp. 

2000-11-29  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* ilisp-snd.el (ilisp-check-package-advanced): Don't signal an
	error if ilisp-no-package-in-core-regexp is nil.

2000-11-15  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Files and directories): added description of the
	  behavior of `load-file-lisp' with .system files.

2000-11-14  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (How to get the latest ILISP distribution):
	  added information about the SourceForge site and mailing lists.
	  (FTP and Web directions, Acknowledgements): added reference to
	  the mailing lists.
	  Updated version info.

	* docs/README: removed redundant version number; minor formatting
	  changes.

	* GETTING-ILISP: added reference to the mailing lists; minor
	  formatting changes.

	* README: updated version number; changed Harlequin to
	  Xanalys/Harlequin; added information about the
	  SourceForge site and mailing lists; minor formatting changes.

2000-11-12  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* Welcome: removed Rick Campbell from the list of current
	  maintainers because he no longer works on ILISP.

2000-11-06    <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* ilisp-cl.el (common-lisp): changed ilisp-hash-form-regexp, so
	that cl:in-package and cl:defpackage is understood as well as
	their variants, with or without the explicit package-marker.

2000-11-06  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-sbcl.el (sblisp-source-directory-regexp,
	  sblisp-local-source-directory): added back because the file
	  includes other references to the variables and since I don't
	  have SBCL, I don't know what's the best approach to removing the
	  obsolete support for source directory.

2000-11-06  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-sbcl.el (ilisp-sblisp-init-file): added comment on init
	  file source extension.
	  (sblisp): added `ilisp-directory-command' and
	  `ilisp-set-directory-command'. William says: "This is a quick
	  hack to make things work for now. In a later version of SBCL I'd
	  like to have a cleaner way of doing this, without reaching into
	  a private implementation package for unsupported functions, and
	  perhaps interacting with CL:*DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* the way
	  that the ANSI spec suggests too."
	  (sblisp-source-directory-regexp, sblisp-local-source-directory):
	  removed because unsupported by SBCL.
	  (patches contributed by William Harold Newman
	  <william.newman@airmail.net>).
	
2000-10-08  Martin Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* ilisp-hnd.el (ilisp-handler): fix call to ilisp-output-buffer.

2000-10-07  Martin Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>
	
	* ilisp-sbcl.el (sblisp): new ilisp-error-regexp.
	
	* ilisp-snd.el (ilisp-check-package-advanced): Due to the
	'in-package behavior (see below) check for errors, and fix them.
	If the package is not found, the fallback-package will be used.
	Display status after a search for package. 
	
	* ilisp-cl.el (common-lisp): ignoring errors in
	ilisp-package-command _does_ not help any ANSI-CL! It is basically
	redundant. This is because of the complicated behavior of
	'in-package (see Hyperspec). 'in-package is implemented as a macro
	in ANSI-CL, and might expand into a '(eval-when (...) something,
	and the error will be thrown, nevertheless of any 'ignore-error
	handler! Modified 'ignore-error -form, because there were some
	strange things happening testing it in CLISP and SBCL.
		
2000-10-03  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-snd.el (lisp-buffer-package-internal): Doesn't try to find
	  unfinished (in-package <nothing-here>) forms when there's
	  nothing to search in. This fixes a bug that broke everything
	  that uses lisp-buffer-package, e.g. set-buffer-package-lisp and
	  evaluation commands (patch contributed by Hannu Koivisto
	  <azure@iki.fi>).

2000-10-01  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-cl.el:
          o (common-lisp):
            o ilisp-package-command now ignores errors.
            o Default value for new ilisp-no-package-in-core-regexp
	      variable.
            o Ditto for ilisp-fallback-package.
	  (patches contributed by Hannu Koivisto <azure@iki.fi>)

	* ilisp-def.el:
          o (ilisp-no-package-in-core-regexp): New local variable.
          o (ilisp-fallback-package): Ditto.
	  (patches contributed by Hannu Koivisto <azure@iki.fi>)

	* ilisp-snd.el:
          o (ilisp-check-package-advanced): If specified for the current
            dialect, ilisp-no-package-in-core-regexp is used to check if
            ilisp-package-command perhaps failed in a way which indicates
            that the package is not in core.  If this is the case,
	    fallback package is returned alongside a new second return
	    value that indicates if the package was not found in core.
          o (lisp-buffer-package-internal): The new second return value of
            ilisp-check-package-advanced is now considered and it's
            possibly propagated to the should-not-cache-p second return
            value of this function.
          o (ilisp-buffer-package-internal):
            o Dummy argument removed.
            o Now returns both a package and a flag suggesting whether
              it's ok to cache the package or not.
            o Doesn't break with unfinished (in-package <nothing-here>)
              forms; in such a case the second return value indicates
              that the returned package should not be cached.
            o Cosmetic if -> when fix.
          o (lisp-buffer-package):
            o Removed (message "") with no known useful purpose.
            o Merged the cond clause of lisp-dont-cache-package being true
              and the default clause.
            o Now considers the flag returned by
	      lisp-buffer-package-internal as its second value.
	  (patches contributed by Hannu Koivisto <azure@iki.fi>)

	* ilisp-hi.el:
          o (ilisp-arglist-message-lisp-space): Now proceeds even if the
	    initial lisp-buffer-packge call doesn't cache the buffer
	    package to buffer-package.
          o (default-directory-lisp): default-direcotory ->
	    default-directory
          o (load-file-lisp):
            o if -> when and if+not -> unless cosmetic fixes.
            o For <whatever>.system files, no compilation or loading of
              possibly existing <whatever>.<binary extension> is
	      attempted.
	  (patches contributed by Hannu Koivisto <azure@iki.fi>)

2000-09-13  Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* sblisp.lisp (ilisp-compile): special case is not necessary
	anymore. removed	

	* cl-ilisp.lisp (ilisp-compile): cleanup.

2000-09-11  Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* ilisp-dia.el (setup-ilisp): use
	ilisp-*enable-ilisp-special-frame-p*.
	If T, push ilisp-buffer on 'special-display-buffer-names.

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-*enable-ilisp-special-frame-p*): new
	variable, put ilisp-buffer-name in special-display-buffer-names,
	if set to T.

2000-09-10  Martin Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* ilisp-out.el: partly incorporated M. Koeppes patch.
	(see 'special-display-buffer-names).
	Kept `ilisp-*arglist-message-switch-back-p*'; if we don't put the
	ilisp-buffer in 'special-display-buffer-names then this is still
	necessary. Might add new variable
	ilisp-*ilisp-buffer-display-special*.

	* ilisp-snd.el (lisp-string-to-symbol): symbol-completion in
	source buffers was broken due to 'ilisp-package-seperator-regex as
	a local variable. fixed.
	
	* Makefile (compile): add '--force' option when linking 'hyperspec.el'.
	
	* ilisp-out.el: (ilisp-make-output-frame)
	incorporated patch by Will Deakin as of August 03.

2000-09-09  Martin Atzmueller  <martin@atzmueller.net>

	* ilisp-hi: (ilisp-arglist-message-lisp-space) handle the special
	case #\".

	* ilisp-sbcl: (sblisp-program) invoke sbcl with --noinform, to
	prevent printing of startup-message.	

2000-08-18  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ChangeLog (2000-08-17, ilisp-imenu.el): fixed wrong attribution
	  of the patch to `imenu--completion-buffer' from Matthias Koeppe
	  to Colin Walters <walters@cis.ohio-state.edu>.

	* ilisp-imenu.el: file unchanged; the commit log of the patch to
	  `imenu--completion-buffer' on 2000-08-17 (ilisp-imenu.el 1.2)
	  incorrectly attributed it to Matthias Koeppe. It was instead
	  contributed by Colin Walters <walters@cis.ohio-state.edu>.

2000-08-17  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* lispworks.lisp (ilisp-source-files): fixed
	  `edit-definitions-lisp' failure when using logical pathnames
	  (patch contributed by Alain Picard
	  <Alain.Picard@memetrics.com>).

	* Makefile (FaslFiles, clean): added Lisp fasl files removal.

	* ilisp.emacs: removed obsolete reference to TMC completion
	  package FTP download (it is included with recent versions of
	  Emacs).

	* ilisp-imenu.el (imenu--completion-buffer): fixed incorrect
	  reference to `string-equal' (patch contributed by Colin Walters
	  <walters@cis.ohio-state.edu>).

2000-08-02  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: updated and sorted alphabetically the list of
	  names.

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Acknowledgements): added William Deakin and
	  Matthias Koeppe.

	* README: added version number and reference to a group of
	  maintainers.

	* GETTING-ILISP: replaced unnecessary reference to explicit
	  version numbers in file names--e.g. 5.9--with generic
	  ones--i.e. x.y.z.

	* extra/README: removed references to version number and date;
	  added hint to check INSTALLATION; fixed capitalization of
	  HyperSpec and added reference to Xanalys.

2000-07-31  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* INSTALLATION: added information on the reference card and
	  setting LN and HyperSpec in Makefile.

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Configuration and compilation): added
	  information on setting LN and HyperSpec in Makefile.

	* Makefile: added commands to link, compile and remove the
	  HyperSpec access package. Now compilation creates
	  `extra/hyperspec.el' as a link/copy of the appropriate package.

	* extra/hyperspec.el: removed to let the makefile create a
	  link/copy to the appropriate HyperSpec package during
	  compilation.

2000-07-27  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* Welcome: updated list of maintainers.

2000-07-24  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* Makefile (DocFiles): added `docs/ilisp-refcard.tex'.
	
	* docs/ilisp.texi (Configuration and compilation): updated for the
	  reference card.

	* docs/README: updated for ilisp-refcard.tex and fixed a couple of
	  typos.

	* docs/Makefile: added support for ilisp-refcard.tex compilation.
	
	* docs/ilisp-refcard.tex: initial revision.
	
	* docs/ilisp-refcard.tgz: removed for keeping only
	  ilisp-refcard.tex.

2000-07-19  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Files of ILISP): clarified entry for *.lisp and
	  added *.scm entry. Updated version info of the document.
	
	* Makefile (clean): added TAGS among the files to remove.

	* ilisp-snd.el (lisp-string-to-symbol): test
	  `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' (patch contributed by Matthias
	  Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).
	
	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): improved error handling for Guile (patch
	  contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).
	
	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-package-separator-regexp): turned into a
	  local variable (patch contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).
	
	* ilisp-cl.el (common-lisp): added
	  `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' (patch contributed by Matthias
	  Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

2000-07-13  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Files of ILISP): uncommented ilisp-cmp.el
	  entry.

	* ilisp-out.el (ilisp-write-string-to-buffer (ilisp-output-sink
	  string)): ensure that the buffer associated to
	  `ilisp-output-sink' exists. The old code only worked for the
	  standard display functions due to their side effects (patch
	  contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

2000-07-12  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-cmp.el (complete-lisp): fixed bug with both XEmacs and GNU
	  Emacs, i.e. doing completion with M-TAB on an empty command line
	  produced the error "Wrong type argument:
	  number-char-or-marker-p,nil" (XEmacs), or "Wrong type argument:
	  number-or-marker-p, nil" with GNU Emacs (patch contributed by
	  William Deakin <w.deakin@pindar.com>).

2000-07-06  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* .ilisp: removed obsolete version of ilisp.emacs.

2000-07-03  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* .ILISP.prcs-aux, ILISP.prj: removed PRCS auxiliary files no
	  longer needed with CVS.
	
2000-06-30  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): fixed malformed
	  `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' assignment (Paolo: pay more
	  attention when committing a change).

2000-06-30  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* INSTALLATION (LispWorks): added info on saving an image without
	  the GUI and making the system work with ILISP under Windows and
	  Linux (contributed by Martin Simmons <martin@harlequin.co.uk>).

2000-06-29  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): sets `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' so
	  that it never matches (patch contributed by Matthias
	  Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-snd.el (lisp-string-to-symbol): uses
	  `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' instead of its hardcoded
	  value in order to work with Guile, and possibly other Schemes
	  (patch contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-package-separator-regexp): added (patch
	  contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>). Matthias suggested
	  `deflocal', I changed it to `defvar' as a temporary workaround
	  because of a bug. After making each dialect set it to the
	  appropriate value, the declaration can be changed to
	  `deflocal'.
	
2000-06-27  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* guile-ilisp.scm: support functions for Guile, which also work
	  with Guile 1.4 (new file contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): improved Guile support (patch contributed
	  by Matthias Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

2000-05-07  Martin Atzmueller  <marty@cs.utexas.edu>

	* sblisp.lisp (source-file): fixed a typo.

	* ilisp-out.el (ilisp-bury-output): incorporated patch by Tim Moore
          in #'ilisp-bury-output: if the output-window was *active* it
          could not be deleted.

	* ilisp-cmp.el (ilisp-complete): if the package of a symbol to
	  be completed was not known an error was _not_ propagated in the
	  right place. fixed.

	* lispworks.lisp: integrated patch by Martin Simmons. UNTESTED. I
	  can't install Lispworks Personal, b/c of failed Deps!

	* ilfsf19.el: integrated patch by Martin Simmons for Emacs
	  19.x. UNTESTED b/c I don't have Emacs19.

	* Makefile: removed 'custom-ilisp.elc' when building a loadfile.

	* ilisp.el: removed load entry for 'custom-ilisp'.

	* ilisp-mak.el: removed load/compile entry for
	'custom-ilisp'. This screwed up when using
	ilisp-*use-fsf-compliant-keybindings*.

2000-05-03  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Replaced occurrences of `Harlequin' with
	`Xanalys/Harlequin'. "Configuration and compilation": Fixed a typo.

2000-04-29  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* INSTALLATION: Added tips for making ILISP work with LispWorks
	(contributed by Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>).

2000-04-26  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Files of ILISP): Uncommented completer.el;
	added custom-ilisp.el; fixed Common Lisp spelling in the
	ilisp-cl.el entry; removed imenu.el.

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Added entry for the dir file (suggestion by
	Matthias Hoelzl <hoelzl@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>).

2000-04-21  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/doc-changes.txt: Restored information lost in the move to
	SourceForge. Added warning stating that the file will no longer be
	maintained.

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Restored changes made in Jan-Feb 2000 and lost
	in the move to SourceForge (see docs/doc-changes.txt). Renamed to
	the ILISP-*VARNAME* convention some variable names missed in the
	transition to ILISP 5.10.1. Fixed the appearance of control
	characters and command names in section "Switching between
	interactive and raw keyboard modes".

	* INSTALLATION: Restored information lost in the move to
	SourceForge (replaced unnecessary references to explicit version
	numbers in file names--e.g. 5.9.4--with generic
	ones--i.e. x.y.z). Renamed variable names to the ILISP-*VARNAME*
	convention.
	
2000-04-19  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@parades.rm.cnr.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Acknowledgements): Added Karl Fogel.

	* ilisp-mak.el (top level): added load/compile entry for
	'custom-ilisp'.

	* ilisp.el (load): added loading of 'custom-ilisp'.

2000-03-26  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@parades.rm.cnr.it>

	* ilisp-dia.el (setup-ilisp): Changed value of
	'ilisp-symbol-delimiter'.

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-bindings-*bind-right-bracket-p*):  Added
	variable to control binding of ']' to 'close-all-lisp'.
	Modified all the places where the above binding is
	set. I.e. 'ilisp-key.el' and 'ilisp-ext.el'.

	* extra/hyperspec.el (common-lisp-hyperspec-root): updated default
	link to new
	'http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/'

	* ilcompat.el (+ilisp-emacs-version-id+): Minimum hack to take
	into account version 21 of Xemacs.  Of course the real thing would
	be to actually upgrade the whole 'compatibility' file support.

2000-02-03  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@onshore.com>

	* doc/ilisp.texi (Keybindings): new node, document the
	FSF-compliant keybinding situation.
	(Miscellany): removed mention of ] for `close-all-lisp' (see
	change to `lisp-bindings' in ilisp-key.el, below).

	* ilisp-def.el: (ilisp-prefix): Set to C-c if above new defcustom
	is non-nil, else set to C-z if above is nil or unbound.
	(ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings): New defcustom.
	(ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings): 

	* ilisp-key.el: (ilisp-safe-define-key): New func, binds a key to
	a command in keymap, using new optional arg FSF-KEY if
	`ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings' is non-nil.
	
	(ilisp-define-ilisp-key-for-map): Replaces `ilisp-defkey'.  Use
	ilisp-safe-define-key, passing new optional argument to it.
	Changed name partly because this function does something new now,
	and partly to avoid confusion with `defkey-ilisp', which has an
	entirely different purpose.  All callers changed.
	
	(lisp-bindings): Use above new functions where appropriate.
	Pass `no-fsf-key' where no worthwhile binding is possible under
	the FSF-approved keyspace.
	Don't bind ] to `close-all-lisp' (see comment in source).

	(defkey-ilisp): take new optional FSF-KEY arg, similarly to
	`ilisp-define-ilisp-key-for-map' (see above).

	* ild.el: pass `no-fsf-key' arg to all keybinding calls here.
