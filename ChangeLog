	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): sets `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' so
	  that it never matches (patch contributed by Matthias
	  Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-snd.el (lisp-string-to-symbol): uses
	  `ilisp-package-separator-regexp' instead of its hardcoded
	  value in order to work with Guile, and possibly other Schemes
	  (patch contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-package-separator-regexp): added (patch
	  contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>). Matthias suggested
	  `deflocal', I changed it to `defvar' as a temporary workaround
	  because of a bug. After making each dialect set it to the
	  appropriate value, the declaration can be changed to
	  `deflocal'.

	* guile-ilisp.scm: support functions for Guile, which also work
	  with Guile 1.4 (new file contributed by Matthias Koeppe
	  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

	* ilisp-sch.el (guile): improved Guile support (patch contributed
	  by Matthias Koeppe <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>).

2000-05-07  Martin Atzmueller  <marty@cs.utexas.edu>

	* sblisp.lisp (source-file): fixed a typo.

	* ilisp-out.el (ilisp-bury-output): incorporated patch by Tim Moore
          in #'ilisp-bury-output: if the output-window was *active* it
          could not be deleted.

	* ilisp-cmp.el (ilisp-complete): if the package of a symbol to
	  be completed was not known an error was _not_ propagated in the
	  right place. fixed.

	* lispworks.lisp: integrated patch by Martin Simmons. UNTESTED. I
	  can't install Lispworks Personal, b/c of failed Deps!

	* ilfsf19.el: integrated patch by Martin Simmons for Emacs
	  19.x. UNTESTED b/c I don't have Emacs19.

	* Makefile: removed 'custom-ilisp.elc' when building a loadfile.

	* ilisp.el: removed load entry for 'custom-ilisp'.

	* ilisp-mak.el: removed load/compile entry for
	'custom-ilisp'. This screwed up when using
	ilisp-*use-fsf-compliant-keybindings*.

2000-05-03  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Replaced occurrences of `Harlequin' with
	`Xanalys/Harlequin'. "Configuration and compilation": Fixed a typo.

2000-04-29  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* INSTALLATION: Added tips for making ILISP work with LispWorks
	(contributed by Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>).

2000-04-26  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Files of ILISP): Uncommented completer.el;
	added custom-ilisp.el; fixed Common Lisp spelling in the
	ilisp-cl.el entry; removed imenu.el.

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Added entry for the dir file (suggestion by
	Matthias Hoelzl <hoelzl@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>).

2000-04-21  Paolo Amoroso  <amoroso@mclink.it>

	* docs/doc-changes.txt: Restored information lost in the move to
	SourceForge. Added warning stating that the file will no longer be
	maintained.

	* docs/ilisp.texi: Restored changes made in Jan-Feb 2000 and lost
	in the move to SourceForge (see docs/doc-changes.txt). Renamed to
	the ILISP-*VARNAME* convention some variable names missed in the
	transition to ILISP 5.10.1. Fixed the appearance of control
	characters and command names in section "Switching between
	interactive and raw keyboard modes".

	* INSTALLATION: Restored information lost in the move to
	SourceForge (replaced unnecessary references to explicit version
	numbers in file names--e.g. 5.9.4--with generic
	ones--i.e. x.y.z). Renamed variable names to the ILISP-*VARNAME*
	convention.
	
2000-04-19  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@parades.rm.cnr.it>

	* docs/ilisp.texi (Acknowledgements): Added Karl Fogel.

	* ilisp-mak.el (top level): added load/compile entry for
	'custom-ilisp'.

	* ilisp.el (load): added loading of 'custom-ilisp'.

2000-03-26  Marco Antoniotti  <marcoxa@parades.rm.cnr.it>

	* ilisp-dia.el (setup-ilisp): Changed value of
	'ilisp-symbol-delimiter'.

	* ilisp-def.el (ilisp-bindings-*bind-right-bracket-p*):  Added
	variable to control binding of ']' to 'close-all-lisp'.
	Modified all the places where the above binding is
	set. I.e. 'ilisp-key.el' and 'ilisp-ext.el'.

	* extra/hyperspec.el (common-lisp-hyperspec-root): updated default
	link to new
	'http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/reference/HyperSpec/'

	* ilcompat.el (+ilisp-emacs-version-id+): Minimum hack to take
	into account version 21 of Xemacs.  Of course the real thing would
	be to actually upgrade the whole 'compatibility' file support.

2000-02-03  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@onshore.com>

	* doc/ilisp.texi (Keybindings): new node, document the
	FSF-compliant keybinding situation.
	(Miscellany): removed mention of ] for `close-all-lisp' (see
	change to `lisp-bindings' in ilisp-key.el, below).

	* ilisp-def.el: (ilisp-prefix): Set to C-c if above new defcustom
	is non-nil, else set to C-z if above is nil or unbound.
	(ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings): New defcustom.
	(ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings): 

	* ilisp-key.el: (ilisp-safe-define-key): New func, binds a key to
	a command in keymap, using new optional arg FSF-KEY if
	`ilisp-use-fsf-compliant-keybindings' is non-nil.
	
	(ilisp-define-ilisp-key-for-map): Replaces `ilisp-defkey'.  Use
	ilisp-safe-define-key, passing new optional argument to it.
	Changed name partly because this function does something new now,
	and partly to avoid confusion with `defkey-ilisp', which has an
	entirely different purpose.  All callers changed.
	
	(lisp-bindings): Use above new functions where appropriate.
	Pass `no-fsf-key' where no worthwhile binding is possible under
	the FSF-approved keyspace.
	Don't bind ] to `close-all-lisp' (see comment in source).

	(defkey-ilisp): take new optional FSF-KEY arg, similarly to
	`ilisp-define-ilisp-key-for-map' (see above).

	* ild.el: pass `no-fsf-key' arg to all keybinding calls here.
